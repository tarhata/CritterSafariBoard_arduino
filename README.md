Arduino code for the functional prototype of the Critter Safari game board and dock. Critter Safari is game that teaches children fundamental computational thinking skills. It pairs an app with a physical block programming interface. The game was designed as a way to expose young girls to computer science skills.

Critter Safari was my team's Capstone project for the Master's in Human-Computer Interaction & Design program at the University of Washington. My roles spanned hardware engineering, user research, and project management.

A more comprehensive overview of the functional prototype can be found at my teammate's github here: https://github.com/parano/CritterSafari
